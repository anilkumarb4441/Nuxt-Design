          <p>
            We’ve combined our deep understanding of human-centered design with
            the science of learning to develop a unique experience that fits
            into your busy life and connects you with like-minded individuals
            across the globe. Through real-life practice and application of new
            concepts, you’ll strengthen your creative problem-solving skills by
            moving away from what's familiar. It’s through moments when you
            experience a failure, see an alternative, or stretch out of your
            comfort zone that learning comes
            <br />
            <br />
            That’s why LEADD lessons are designed to challenge assumptions and
            provoke new ways of working. You’ll learn from esteemed
            practitioners who apply these methods every day in their own work,
            and who have a passion for teaching at LEADD as well as at
            universities including Stanford, Oxford, Northwestern, University of
            California at Berkeley, and TsingHua University.
            <br />
            <br />
            Based on best practices from the field of learning science, the
            LEADD experience engages learners in cycles of see, try, share, and
            reflect. Our single courses engage you in this cycle several times,
            while our certificate programs take you through multiple cycles,
            resulting in deeper learning and professional impact.

              The practice and application of design thinking, innovation, and
              creativity is highly collaborative and team based—which is why we
              believe that learning is better together. Take a course as a team
              and develop new skills and mindsets, have deeper discussion during
              course kickoff and debrief sessions, and build a shared
              understanding.
